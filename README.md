🔭 I’m passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Human-Centered Technology. My journey spans from backend engineering to AI research, and I’m currently exploring ways to build AI systems that are fair, transparent, and meaningful in real-world applications like healthcare and hiring.

💭 My mission is to design and develop AI systems that are human-first, bridging the gap between technology and emotion, science and creativity.

👯 I’m always open to collaborations, research opportunities, and discussions in NLP, AI fairness, and cross-cultural AI systems. Feel free to reach out if our interests align!

### Bio

🧠 I’m currently an AI/ML Engineering Intern at Blue AI Labs, building a multi-agent recruiting platform using LangChain, Python Fast APIs, and React. Before this, I worked at Deloitte Digital, where I helped secure Australia’s largest forex provider with scalable, Auth0-based identity systems and real-time dashboards.

📝 My research interests lie at the intersection of **NLP and responsible AI**. I’ve published and presented work at IEEE ISMAR 2023 on individualized virtual reality for mental health and developed multiple end-to-end systems—ranging from fairness-aware facial recognition to AI-powered resume screening.

🌱 I’m pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science** with an AI/ML focus at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**. I hold a **Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering* (Dual Degree) from the **University of Queensland**.

### Outside the Lab

🎨 I’m a lifelong learner with a monthly rotation of new hobbies—from crocheting and violin to experimenting with digital art and animation.

🩰 I’m a classically trained Bharatanatyam dancer and Carnatic vocalist with over 12 years of training. My passion for music, language, art, and culture deeply informs how I think about AI—particularly its cultural sensitivity and potential for human connection.

🎥 I love exploring how language and culture mirror one another, diving into history, cinema, and psychology as fuel for both curiosity and creativity.
